Homework 2 - Theo Mayer
This app uses GeoDB Cities API to populate a SQLite database with countries and cities.
Since it is the free version, it only can fetch a limited number of countries and cities.
The user can click on the links in the navbar to be taken to two different forms for queries.
There's one where they can search for a country, and it will display some information about said country.
In the other one, they can filter cities by name, region, or country. It will then display cities that match that criteria.
